Graphing Calculator Demo
========================

Demo of a Javascript graphing calculator using `d3.js <http://d3js.org>`_ and `math.js <http://mathjs.org/>`_.

Created as part of a three-part blog series detailing my initial exploration of d3:

- `Part 1 <http://ericplumb.com/blog/graphing-calculator-part-1.html>`_
- `Part 2 <http://ericplumb.com/blog/graphing-calculator-part-2.html>`_
- `Part 3 <http://ericplumb.com/blog/graphing-calculator-part-3.html>`_

Usage

Dependencies d3.js and math.js are loaded via HTTP so no local installation is necessary.
